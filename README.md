# Assignment on creating a UI for a website
For context, the website UI created is for educational purposes, specifically a university website for students. It was a group assignment, however the majority of the structure and layout is the result of my ideas, that is not to take anything away from my team member, we simply ended up choosing most of my ideas - he did contribute. The focus of the assignment was on the UI - the website wasn't supposed to be in a state ready to be used professionally.

## The structure explained
Keeping it as simple as possible was important in my opinion. The navigation bar consists of the `Home` page, `Modules`, `Course`, and `Profile` (there's also `Login`, but that was a pseudo login, it isn't functional due to using Google Sites).

## `Home`
The most important and most used contents are present here, these are direct links to specific modules, information on assignment deadlines, and the timetable.

## `Modules`
This drop down menu has three tabs, namely `Semester 1`, `Semester 2`, and `Year Long`. These tabs themselves have a few tabs, which are the specific modules. This means that the modules are organised according to which semester they belong to, resulting in easy navigation.

## `Course`
This menu contains some useful information for students, such as exam timetables, lecturer details, campus maps etc.

## `Profile`
This page holds basic information on the logged in student, such as name, location, and email. 

## Structure of modules
When clicking on any of the modules, you will be directed to the corresponding page. This page is made up of three sections, the notes, grades, and past exam papers. The notes are divided into 12 sections, representing the weeks of the semester. It's a `3 * 4` grid, which offers a simple layout for the notes. For example, our university's website for students has a separate page for each week, but I thought this is wasteful and too annoying to navigate. This way you are able to see all of the notes because they're well organised, and in one place. The grades and past exam paper sections were my team member's idea, so I'm not going to take credit for that.
